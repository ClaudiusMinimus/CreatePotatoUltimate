Installation Instructions

1. Open your file manager and navigate to your instance of Create on a Potato 
    PC: Ultimate 1.19.2-4.9.1 and rename "/minecraft/kubejs" to "/minecraft/kubejs_old"
2. Extract/Un-Zip CreatePotatoUltimate_1.19.2-4.9.1_patch.zip
3. Copy the extracted folder, "kubejs" to "/minecraft/kubejs" so that it replaces 
    the old "kubejs" folder - it should resemble the following:

    /minecraft/kubejs
        - assets (folder)
        - client_scripts (folder)
        - README.txt
        - server_scripts (folder)
        - startup_scripts (folder)

4. If your game is still running open chat and run the command "/reload". If your
    game is not running, start it up, load a world, and skip to step 6.
5. The chat should return:
    1st. "Reloading!"
    2nd. "Reloaded with no KubeJS errors!
6. Open JEI and you will have new recipes for:
    1. Using a Brass Mesh with Gravel to obtain 9 restored recipes that 
    were lost due to the Create 0.5.1 update.
    2. Four Blaze Powder to make one Blaze Rod. This recipe is needed for
    the Botania Blaze Mesh quest.
