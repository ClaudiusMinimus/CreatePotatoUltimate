The Cart Assemblers can take a bit to learn to use, but when you have mastered this device, you will learn to love it."

				"To use, you need to first put down a minecart rail. Then place the Cart Assembler over the rail, then whatever it is you want to assemble. Place a Minecart on the rail and a lever on the Cart Assembler, and activate it. You will notice the Cart Assembler will rise slightly and you are ready to make the magic begin. If you shift-right click with a Create Wrench on the minecart, you will pick up the assembly. To place, put down a rail and break the Minecart and you have moved your assembly. There is so much more to the Cart Assembler and I highly recommend watching some videos on how to set it up and use it."
